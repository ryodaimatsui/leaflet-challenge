## Project Overview 
"The United States Geological Survey, or USGS for short, is responsible for providing scientific data about natural hazards, the health of our ecosystems and environment, and the impacts of climate and land-use change. Their scientists develop new methods and tools to supply timely, relevant, and useful information about the Earth and its processes. The USGS is interested in building a new set of tools that will allow them to visualize their earthquake data. They collect a massive amount of data from all over the world each day, but they lack a meaningful way of displaying it" (Penn Data Analysis and Visualization, 2023). 

Goal: Development of an Interactive Geographic Information System for Visualizing Earthquake Data

## Data Source
The dataset for this project comprises earthquake events with a magnitude greater than 4.5 that occurred over the past 7 days, obtained from the USGS website.

## Data Processing
JavaScript, particularly the D3.js library, was employed for data retrieval and visualization.

## Mapping and Visualization
The Leaflet library, in conjunction with GeoJSON, was the primary tool for mapping and visually representing the earthquake data on an interactive map.
